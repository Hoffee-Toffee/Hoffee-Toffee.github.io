## DESIGN

## THEME, FONT, AND COLORS

For my website, I'm going to attempt to create a slick, modern theme with sci-fi elements.
The site will be more modern than sci-fi, but the sci-fi elements will be used to accent the modern theme.
The colors will be black (background), white (text), with a blue (holographics and links) and orange (highlighting and error messages) accent.
The site should have a clean, minimalistic design with a lot of white space.
The sci-fi elements will be designed like the holographic designs from Dead Space.
The site will be designed to be responsive and mobile friendly.

For fonts I will use Roboto, which is a modern, clean font.
I will also attempt to get the license to use the font used in the Dead Space games, which is called "Russell Square".

## PAGE DESIGNS

### COMMON HEADER AND FOOTER

The header and footer will be the same on every page.
Both have scrolling blue lines that move in the background, and a scanline effect to give the site a retro sci-fi feel.

The header contains the site title (Will try different titles like "Tristan's Portfolio" or "Tristan Bulmer") and a navigation bar (which becomes a toggleable hamburger menu on mobile).
The navigation bar contains links to the home page, the projects page, and the interests page.

The footer will contain links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, Email and Twitter.

### HOME PAGE

The home page will contain a brief introduction to me, my prior experience, education etc.
The first section will be the first thing you see when you visit the site, so it will have to contain an interesting, but not distracting, gimmick.

### PROJECTS PAGE

This page will automatically get all the projects of mine that I have starred on GitHub.
It will display a title, description, screenshot, a link to the GitHub page, and a link to the project submodule page (as live site).

### INTERESTS PAGE

This page will contain a list of my interests, with a short description of each.
Each interest will fill the viewport, and will have a background image with a moving foreground image.
There will also be links to relevant pages.
All images will be designed to be responsive and mobile friendly, and will have their sources listed on the final page.
