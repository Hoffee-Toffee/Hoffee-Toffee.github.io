## DESIGN

## THEME, FONT, AND COLORS

For my website, I'm going to attempt to create a slick, modern theme with sci-fi elements.
The site will be more modern than sci-fi, but the sci-fi elements will be used to accent the modern theme.
The colors will be black (background), white (text), with a blue (holographics and links) and orange (highlighting and error messages) accent.
The site should have a clean, minimalistic design with a lot of white space.
The sci-fi elements will be designed like the holographic designs from Dead Space.
The site will be designed to be responsive and mobile friendly.

For fonts I will use Roboto, which is a modern, clean font.
I attempted to get the license to use the font used in the Dead Space games, which is called "Russell Square".

## PAGE DESIGNS

### COMMON HEADER AND FOOTER

The header and footer will be the same on every page.
Both have scrolling blue lines that move in the background, to give the site a retro sci-fi feel.

The header contains the site title and a navigation bar (which becomes a toggleable hamburger menu on mobile).
The navigation bar contains links to the home page, the projects page, and the interests page.

The footer will contain links to my GitHub.

### HOME PAGE

The home page will contain a brief introduction to me, my prior experience, education etc.

### PROJECTS PAGE

This page will automatically get all the projects of mine that I have starred on GitHub.
It will display a title, description, screenshot, a link to the GitHub page, and a link to the project submodule page (as live site).

### INTERESTS PAGE

This page will contain a list of my interests, with a short description of each.
Each interest will fill the viewport, and will have a background image with a moving foreground image.
There will also be links to relevant pages.
All images will be designed to be responsive and mobile friendly.
