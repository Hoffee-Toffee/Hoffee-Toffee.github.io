                    <!-- Dead Space is a sci-fi horror game series praised for it's overall design, atmosphere, and story.
                        I love the series due to how they approached the design of the game, it being sci-fi is a plus, and the story is very interesting.

                        Horror games rely on the player feeling like the events are happening to them, making immersion a key factor.
                        Dead Space does this with diagetic UI, helping to immerse the player into the game world, boosting the 'horror' aspect of the game as it helps the player feel like they are in the game world.
                        For example, the Isaac's health is displayed as a meter on the spine of the suit, inspired by oxygen meters from diving suits.
                        Ammo counters are displayed on the weapon itself, so the user can aim and see how much ammo they have left at the same time.
                        The game's inventory and mission information is displayed through the suit's holographic operating system, used in-universe to aid workers with their tasks.
                        Isaac can navigate the ship by using a holographic projector mounted to his palm, which projects a line on the floor to guide him.

                    <h1>Dead Space</h1>
                    <p>
                        I love the Dead Space series not for the horror; but for the rich design of the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a horror game, it relies on players feeling as if the events are happening to them, which is why realistic and immersive design is so important.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dead Space's sci-fi setting builds perfectly on this, adding to the isolation and wonder of the game.

                    <p>
                        The sci-fi aspect is used for the diagetic UI, with elements such as...

                    <ul>
                        <li>Health meters inspired by diving suit oxygen meters.</li>

                        The shared universe allows for great crossovers and storylines, with long arcs and consequences.
                        I like Marvel for the stories, the characters, and the universe.

                        Infinity War, Tony Stark, and Doctor Strange are some of my favorite things in the MCU.

                        Infinity War had great visual effects, a good story, and had many unexpected moments.

                        Tony Stark is a brilliant character, with a great arc from a selfish playboy to a hero.
                        He is a great character to relate to, as he is a flawed human, and is a great example of how to overcome adversity.
                        His technology also plays a big part in the MCU.

                        Doctor Strange went from a cocky surgeon to a powerful sorcerer, showing how a person can change.
                        It also helps that his magic is very cool.

                        I love making and designing creative solutions to problems.
                        I love thinking about problems at a fundamental level, it's fun chipping a way at large problems, exploring the entirety of the problem, and finding cool solutions and ideas.
                        
                        Most of my programming experience is in web development, but I am getting bit into game development via my Supe Game project.
                        I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, SQL, and Node.js.

                        Currently in the process of becoming a GitHub Campus Expert.
                        The languages I am most familiar with are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.
                        Python was my first language, but I don't use it as much as I used to.
                        I have some experience with PHP and SQL, and am currently getting back into SQL for some of my projects.

                        Things I have made in the past include...
                        - Countless python scripts (text games, web scrapers, etc.)
                        - Two Discord bots (one with a bunch of silly commands and features, and one that I used to manage and control my Minecraft server)
                        - Several websites

                        I am currently working on...
                        - Supe Game and a website for it
                        - This portfolio website
                        - A dynamic timeline node mapping tool for visuallising the connections between people, events, objects and concepts in stories
                        - A website emulating the UI of the Dead Space games
