      <h2>Techniques</h2>

      <h3>Reading Error Messages</h3>

      <p>
        Usually the first thing I'll do.<br />
        The only exception would be if it's an error that I recognise straight
        away by the page/app being in a way that it shouldn't.<br />
        And the other main exception is for languages such as CSS, that don't
        provide such messages.
      </p>

      <h3>Trying Something</h3>

      <p>
        If I don't have a solution yet, but have an idea of what it could be,
        then my next step is to just try that out.<br />
        Otherwise I'll just try another method.
      </p>

      <h3>Console.logging</h3>

      <p>
        If it's a problem with the value of a variable, or with the execution of
        a function, then I will probably use this technique to learn more about
        the nature of the problem.
      </p>

      <h3>Pseudocode</h3>

      <p>
        If the problem is too big for the previous methods, then I may use an
        internal form of pseudocode to follow the process for myself.<br />
        I frequently use the console.logging process within this as well, making
        sure each step does as it is supposed to in the process.
      </p>

      <h3>"Rubber Ducky"</h3>

      <p>
        Very rarely have I had to explain a problem aloud to solve it.<br />
        In the past when I have, it has been to
        <a href="./choco.html">my cat</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Googling</h3>

      <p>
        If I come across a new error or a step I don't know how to code, then
        Googling is the next step.<br />
        I don't search on specific websites, but as many know, Stack Overflow is
        probably the prime resource I use, save for W3 Schools.
      </p>

      <h3>Asking Others</h3>

      <p>
        Generally if none of the methods work, then the problem is hard enough
        that a peer may not help.<br />
        Exceptions being if I feel I need a second pair of eyes, or if I know of
        someone who has overcome a similar problem and it would be faster to ask
        them then to explore for myself.
