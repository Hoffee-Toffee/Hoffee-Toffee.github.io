      <h1>CSS Positioning</h1>
      <subtitle>Relative, Absolute, and Fixed positioning</subtitle>

      <h2>Absolute</h2>
      <p>
        Absolute positioning means to place the element relative to the first
        parent up the chain that has position relative or absolute (or the page
        itself if none).
        <br />
        This is very useful, it is like choosing coordinates within these bounds
        as to place the element.
        <br />
        Think of it as choosing coordinates within these bounds to place the
        element.
        <br />
        <br />
        For example, if you do...
        <code-input
          lang="css"
          value="#absolute {
  position: absolute;
  top: 5em;
  right: 0;
}"
        ></code-input>
        ...then it will place the element 5em from the top of the bounds
        (nearest parent that fits the conditions above), which is the page in
        this context.
        <span id="absolute" class="box">Absolute: (Relative to page)</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        This will also remove it from the 'flow' meaning that it won't push
        other elements where it was.
      </p>

      <h2>Fixed</h2>
      <p>
        Fixed positioning means to place the element relative to screen,
        unaffected by scroll.
        <br />
        Think of it like it's coordinates on your physical screen, as if it were
        a sticky note placed on the screen itself.
        <br />
        <br />
        For example, if you do...
        <code-input
          lang="css"
          value="#fixed {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 50vh;
  right: 0;
}"
        ></code-input>
        ...then it will place the element on the screen, halfway from the
        bottom.
        <span id="fixed" class="box">Fixed: (Relative to screen)</span>
        <br />
        Very handy for navigation bars and footers.
        <br />
        Also taken out of flow.
      </p>

      <h2>Relative</h2>
      <p>
        Relative positioning means to place the element relative to itself.
        <br />
        Think of it as simply offsetting.
        <br />
        <br />
        For example, if you do...
        <code-input
          lang="css"
          value="#relative {
  position: relative;
  top: 2em;
  right: 0;
}"
        ></code-input>
        ...then it will shift the element down by this amount.
        <br />
        This is compared to it's original position.
        <br />
        <br />

        <span id="relative" class="box">Relative: (Relative to itself)</span>
        <- RELATIVE BLOCK USED TO BE HERE | COVERED TEXT | COVERED TEXT |
        COVERED TEXT | COVERED TEXT | COVERED TEXT | COVERED TEXT | COVERED TEXT
        | COVERED TEXT | COVERED TEXT | COVERED TEXT | COVERED TEXT | COVERED
        TEXT | COVERED TEXT | COVERED TEXT | COVERED TEXT | COVERED TEXT |
        COVERED TEXT | COVERED TEXT | COVERED TEXT | COVERED TEXT
      </p>

      <h2>Notes</h2>
      Using any of these (or any that are just not 'static') also allows for the
      use of
      <span style="text-wrap: nowrap"
        >'<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index"
          >z-index</a
        >'</span
      >
      which is very handy and is used to change layering.
