      <h1>Learning Plan Revisited</h1>

      <h2>Career goals</h2>

      <p>No change.</p>

      <h2>Learning strengths and limitations</h2>

      <p>No change.</p>

      <h2>Non-technical skills to develop</h2>

      <p>No change.</p>

      <h2>Workload commitment</h2>

      <p>
        Will have plenty of time on weekdays and weekends to do work.
        <br />
        I cook every third day, with big enough portions to last the next three
        days.
        <br />
        Everything in this section of my original plan still applies.
      </p>

      <h2>Assistance commitment</h2>
      <p>No change.</p>

      <h2>Expectations of facilitation team</h2>
      <p>No change.</p>

      <h2>Scheduling information</h2>
      <p>
        Shopping I'll do on the way back from Bootcamp.
        <br />
        I don't have a day pencilled in as 'Shopping Day' as I wouldn't get much
        if done on a weekly basis.
        <br />
        If that changes then I will, otherwise I'll just shop when I actually
        need to.
        <br />
        <br />
        I plan to visit my sister for dinner one time a week, so that would take
        up most of an evening.
        <br />
        Otherwise, I don't go out anywhere.
