      <h1>EQ</h1>

      <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>

      <p>
        All about understanding of emotions, including finding root causes,
        expressing, controlling your emotions, and understanding others.
      </p>

      <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>

      <p>
        IQ is all about how you generally approach problems, while EQ is
        centered around only how you understand and deal with emotions.
      </p>

      <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>

      <p>
        Emotions are not generally rational, but they are logical<br />
        As complex as they can be, they are not random<br />
        <br />
        Understanding your own situation or that of others is powerful to
        working together well<br />
        Even simply understanding that emotions are logical can help you accept,
        but not always agree with them<br />
        This is usually the most crucial element, as it is always the first step
        in working with the emotions of yourself and others
      </p>
