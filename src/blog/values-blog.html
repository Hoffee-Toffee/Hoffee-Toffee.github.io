      <h2>An ethical decision</h2>

      <p>
        Probably the longest blog I have done, it took me quite a while of
        writing and editing to get it to a point that I am comfortable with
        sharing.

        <br />

        This was about the only real impactful ethical decision that I have
        made.

        <br />
        The story below has been heavily sanitized.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was in a group project with four friends.
        <br />

        After divvying up the tasks and initial planning, things went off to a
        pretty good start.

        <br />

        I focused on getting my share of the project done, but it wasn't long
        before the other four people began having disputes over a certain aspect
        of the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, the project was pretty fleshed out, almost 3 months in.

        <br />

        Things started to get fairly heated and I was put in a very
        uncomfortable situation where each side tried to get me to back them.

        <br />

        The dispute was split with 2 on each side, it started with each side
        attempting to explain and convince everyone else of their plan.

        <br />

        Both sides became fixed, but I remained neutral, considering and
        responding to each point on merit alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        As time went on, this led to each side wanting me to help pressure the
        other side into giving up.

        <br />

        And then it led to each side wanting to continue the project without the
        others.

        <br />

        However, both wanted to have the majority to have an advantage, so I was
        fought over.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project was at a complete standstill at this point, all I wanted was
        to continue work.

        <br />

        I again remained neutral, as each side was now being very petty, I
        didn't want anything to do with it.

        <br />

        At this point, I was praised by a side whenever I agreed with their
        point and berated when I didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had to leave the project at this time because of the stress.
        <br />

        It didn't help that I really enjoyed the work - when we were actually
        working - and I had to give that up, I missed it a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not sure exactly what happened during the next month or so, but
        another member eventually left for what I assume to be the same reason
        that I did.

        <br />

        The other person on their side was basically forced to leave also, and
        after a while the remaining two invited me back.

        <br />

        The two that left remain very bitter after the ordeal, which isn't
        surprising, given the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It took me a fair while to decide that I would rejoin.
        <br />

        I was never happy about doing so, It'd already soured two friendships,
        so I decided that I would not lose the project too.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish I had had the confidence and skills to resolve the conflict,
        without it ending as it did.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project was never the same again, and it ended up costing two good
        friendships.
      </p>

      <h2>Influences</h2>

      <p>
        Grew up in a pretty divided family, parents each having incompatable
        views on life.<br />
        That kind of left me not knowing what to think, which was pretty hard,
        but I think it had some positives.<br />
        It did mean that I didn't have any strong beliefs from a young age,
        anything I would accept as true at an age before I could truly think
        things through.<br />
        The difference in views always left me feeling like a bit of an
        outsider, probably a factor in my social anxiety and low confidence.<br />
        I generally do fine in everyday activities, but not so much if it's
        anything personal or new, which is to be expected really.
      </p>

      <h2>Strengths</h2>

      <p>
        I have many years of programming experience, just not in industry.<br />
        I also have a passion for it, which will be helpful.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitations</h2>

      <p>
        As mentioned previously, I have little confidence, as well as little
        self-esteem.
      </p>

      <h2>Stratagies</h2>

      <p>
        Well, going off the group project incident described above, there is a
        strategy that I do try to use.<br />
        It probably came out of thinking for programming, but I now often do it
        with plot in stories also.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is by simply outlining all the properties a solution must have,
        including anything ruled out.<br />
        Using this and other data available, I can build on this and eventually
        get to a solution, or occasionally find a clash which means it can't
        work (unless another element is changed to resolve the clash).<br />
        It's something I've been trying to build into a habit.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the group project, I used this strategy myself, but it was never
        adopted by the rest of the group and did very little in the end.
