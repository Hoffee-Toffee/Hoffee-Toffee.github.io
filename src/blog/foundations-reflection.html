      <h2>What have you learnt from Core?</h2>

      <p>
        Wouldn't say I've learnt much, but certainly got a starting grasp at
        some tools to help me in the future.
      </p>

      <h2>How does Core relate to programming?</h2>

      <p>
        To be a good developer, you need to have the skills to work well in a
        team.<br />
        Core is all about working on your inter-personal skills, the most
        important skill for working in a team.
      </p>

      <h2>What has surprised you about Core?</h2>

      <p>It surprised me how much work it took.</p>

      <h2>What has been challenging in Core?</h2>

      <p>
        Writing all the blog posts and reflections, also not a fan of doing
        voice/video activities.<br />
        Much more comfortable in person, makes it so much easier.
      </p>

      <h2>Why teach Core?</h2>

      <p>Pretty much summed up when asking how it relates.</p>

      <h2>Has Core been helpful to you?</h2>

      <p>
        It's been good preparation for the bootcamp, but I don't feel I have
        learnt much.<br />
        Sounds like the Core activities during the bootcamp will be more useful
        however.<br />
        <br />
        Since I have programming experience I could get through the programming
        exercizes fairly quickly.<br />
        But not so much with Core, has taken up most of my time in foundations.
