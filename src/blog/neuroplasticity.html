      <h2>What is it?</h2>

        >
        is the ability of the brain to change due to experience.<br />
        It is very relevant to learning, as to learn you need to adapt to and
        absorb new knowledge and experience.<br />
        <br />
        Neuroplasticity is commonly paired with the idea of a 'growth mindset',
        which is all about how to handle setbacks and approach problems to
        improve your skills.<br />
        Improving the plasticity of your brain has mainly benefits, including
        streamlining learning, improved memory and concentration, keener
        cognitive skills, and can aid struggles with some mental health issues.

      <h2>In Practice</h2>

      <p>
        There are two main classes of activities you can do to increase your
        plasticity.<br />
        Cognitive and physical exercise, and cognitive reflection.<br />
        <br />
        This includes activities such as learning new skills, resting
        frequently, and going for runs or walks in new places/routes.<br />
        For me, I'll likely go for walks, create music (albeit shoddy), and
        exploring new programming concepts.
