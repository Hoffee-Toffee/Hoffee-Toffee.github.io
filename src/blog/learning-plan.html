      <h1>Learning Plan</h1>

      <h2>Career goals</h2>

      <p>
        Back-end web development, in the future maybe something more ambitious.
      </p>

      <h2>Learning strengths and limitations</h2>

      <p>
        Good at learning through exploration. But not as good with completely
        unstructured learning.
      </p>

      <h2>Non-technical skills to develop</h2>

      <p>
        Confidence
        <br />
        Improving work ethic
      </p>

      <h2>Workload commitment</h2>

      <p>
        For foundations I have just been building a daily routine.<br />
        That will likely be stuffed up once I get to Wellington for the
        bootcamp.<br />
        But, I will go up there a week before we work in-person.<br />
        <br />
        Where I will be staying is near a park, so I might go there if stressed.
        <br />
        I'll also be staying near where my sister is, so I'll be able to see her
        also.<br />
        <br />
        Mostly I'd probably chill inside to relax, but I don't know my flatmates
        yet so that could actually be more stressful.
      </p>

      <h2>Assistance commitment</h2>
      <p>
        If I find myself sitting on a problem for an extended time then I'll
        likely reach out to other students first, then any facilitators if
        required.
      </p>

      <h2>Expectations of facilitation team</h2>
      <p>Mostly to provide guidance and to facilitate learning.</p>

      <h2>Scheduling information</h2>
      <p>
        At the moment I have nothing pencilled in, but again, once I'm in
        Wellington I will develop a routine.
        <br />
        I simply don't know enough to plan until I arrive.
      </p>
