      <h1>
        Welcome to my portfolio!
      </h1>

      <p>
        I'm studying at <a href="https://devacademy.co.nz/">Dev Academy</a>, New Zealand.
        <br>
        For my blog for Dev Academy, see <a href="../blog/blog.html">here</a>.
        <br>
        I'm currently working on a few personal <a href="../projects/projects.html">projects</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think computers and programming are awesome and are one of my main <a href="../interests/interests.html">interests</a>.
        <br>
        I love making and designing creative solutions to problems by thinking about them at a fundamental level, it's fun chipping a way at large problems, exploring the entirety of the problem, and finding cool solutions and ideas.
        <br>
      </p>

      <p>
        Most of my programming experience is in web development, but I am getting bit into game development via my Supe Game project.
        <br>
        I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, SQL, Node.js, and AutoHotKey.
        <br>
        The languages I am most familiar with are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.
        <br>
        Python was my first language, but I don't use it as much as I used to.
        <br>
        I have some experience with PHP and SQL, and am currently getting back into SQL for some of my projects.
        <br>
      </p>

      <h2>
        Things I have made in the past include...
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Countless python scripts (text games, web scrapers, etc.)</li>
        <li>Two Discord bots (one with a bunch of silly commands and features, and one that I used to manage and control my Minecraft server)</li>
        <li>A few websites (most are terrible from when I was starting out and messing around)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Most of my previous projects are not yet on github, but I plan to add them soon.
      </p>
